\begin{abstract}
Area ($2d$-) detectors like \textsc{ccd} or pixel detectors have replaced
punctual detectors over the 15 last years in diffraction (both in \textsc{waxs},
\textsc{saxs} and single crystal diffraction). Those detectors with wide sensitive area have micron-sized spatial
resolution and provide millions of pixels. PyFAI was designed to reduce \textsc{saxs} and
\textsc{waxs} images taken with those detectors into $1d$ curve (azimuthal integration)
or $2d$ images (transformation named caking), usable by other software like
Rietveld refinement tools.

As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated in other tools like
PyMca\cite{pymca} or \textsc{edna}\cite{edna} with a clear pythonic interface. But pyFAI
offers also command line tools for batch processing, exporting data in q-space (for \textsc{saxs}) or 2$\theta$ for
(\textsc{waxs}) and a calibration GUI for optimizing the geometry of the setup
using reference sample's \textit{powder rings}.  PyFAI shares the geometry
of \textsc{spd}\cite{spd} but can directly import geometries determined by
\textsc{fit2d}\cite{fit2d1996}.
PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and
relies on FabIO\cite{fabio}, a library able to read more than 20 image
formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers.

Even if the basic idea is interpolation from cartesian space $(x,y)$ to polar
space $(2\theta, \chi )$, intensities should be conserved (both local and total)
to get quantitative results.  Those technical details on how integration is implemented
and how it was ported to native C-code and parallelized on graphic card are
discussed  in this paper.

\section{Introduction}

With the advent of hyperspectral experiments like diffraction tomography in the
world of synchrotron radiation, existing tools for azimuthal integration like
\textsc{fit2d}\cite{fit2d1996} and \textsc{spd}\cite{spd} reached their limits with the fast data rate
needed by such experiments. Even when integrated into massively parallel
frameworks like \textsc{edna}\cite{edna}, such stand-alone programs, due to their
monolithic nature, could not keep pace with the data flow of new detectors.

\section{Fast azimuthal integration}
This highlights the need for a new tool for performing azimuthal integration
much faster than before, without compromising quality. This tool is
implemented in Python, which is already very popular for data
analysis (PyMca\cite{pymca}, PyNX\cite{pynx}, \ldots) and open source.

\subsection{PyFAI executables}
PyFAI was designed to be used by scientists needing a simple tool for azimuthal
integration. Two command line programs \textit{pyFAI-waxs} and
\textit{pyFAI-saxs} are provided with pyFAI for performing the
integration of one or many images. The \textsc{waxs} version outputs results in
$2\theta /I$  whereas the \textsc{saxs} version outputs $q/I(/\sigma )$.
Options for those programs are parameter files describing the geometry and mask file. They can
also do some  pre-processing like dark-noise subtraction and flat-field correction.

\subsection{A Python library}
PyFAI is first and foremost a library: a tool of the scientific
toolbox built around ipython\cite{ipython} and numpy\cite{numpy} to
perform data-analysis either interactively or via scripts.
Figure \ref{notebook} shows an interactive session where an integrator is
created, and image loaded and integrated before being plotted.

interactive environment ipython.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Regrouping mechanism}
In pyFAI, regrouping is performed using a histogram-like algorithm. 
Each pixel of the image is associated to it's polar coordinates
$(2\theta , \chi )$ or $(q, \chi )$. Then a pair of histograms of $2\theta$
(or $q$) are built, one non weighted for measuring the number of pixels falling in each bin and
another weighted by pixel intensities.
The division of the weighted histogram by the number of pixels per bin gives
the powder pattern.
$2d$ regrouping (called \textit{caking} in \textsc{fit2d}) is obtained in the
same way using two-dimensional histograms over radial ($2\theta$ or $q$) and azimuthal angles
($\chi$).

\subsection{Pixel splitting algorithm}
Powder diffraction patterns obtained by histogramming have a major weakness where
statistic is low.
%: a high level of  noise is observed close to the beam stop.
A manifestation of this weakness becomes apparent in $2d$-regroupping where most of
the bins close to the beam-stop are not populated by any pixel.
In Figure \ref{rough} many pixels are missing in the low $2\theta$ region,
which is not acceptable. 
The  $2d$-regrouping of a smooth image should be smooth(Figure \ref{smooth}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}{8cm}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/2Dhistogram.eps}
\caption{\label{rough}$2d$-regrouped image without pixel splitting. Note
the missing pixels near the beam stop and the high-frequency noise patterns.}
\end{minipage}\hspace{5mm}
\begin{minipage}{8cm}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{img/2DwithSplit.eps}
\caption{\label{smooth}$2d$-regrouped image with pixel splitting. The
transformation of a smooth image remains smooth.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

PyFAI solves this problem by considering, in addition to the pixel's position,
their spatial extension. Each pixel is then split and distributed over the
corresponding bins; intensity being considered as homogeneous in a pixel.

\subsection{Performances and migration to native code}
Originally the regrouping was implemented
using the histogram provided by numpy\cite{numpy}; then re-implemented in
cython\cite{cython} with pixel splitting to achieve a four times speed-up.
The computation time is governed by the size of the input image; the performances 
are above 30 Mpix/s on a 3.4GHz Intel corei7.

\subsection{Graphic card implementation}
Graphics Processing Units (\textsc{gpu}s) are composed of hundreds of
arithmetic logic units; they are optimized for highly
parallel algorithms with speed-ups reaching up to 3 orders of magnitude over sequential
code running on Central Processing Units (\textsc{cpu}).
While histograms do not fall into this category, they can nevertheless be
ported to \textsc{gpu} efficiently.
In order to benefit from \textsc{gpu} acceleration,
the Open Computing Language\cite{opencl} (OpenCL) was used. OpenCL can make use
of multiple different devices such as \textsc{cpu}s and \textsc{gpu}s with very
different features and capabilities.
OpenCL allows the code to work on multiple \textsc{cpu} cores, which was
useful for validation. 
As azimuthal integration is a reduction
of millions of pixels into hundreds of bins, double-precision arithmetics must
be used, which however is not available on all OpenCL devices.
Table \ref{perfs} summarizes the execution time for images coming from
various detectors on a dual-processor computer, either using the
cython single threaded implementation, either OpenCL on the 16
\textsc{cpu} cores or the 512 \textsc{gpu} cores of the nVidia Tesla C2075 or
GTX580 or 1440 \textsc{gpu} cores of the AMD FirePro v7800 (on the later,
integrations were made in single precision).

\end{center}
\end{table}

The OpenCL implementation of pyFAI is very fast on \textsc{gpu} offering an extra five
time speed-up over \textsc{cpu} implementation. The profiling of the code revealed new
bottlenecks which will be addressed in future optimization. OpenCL
implementation of $2d$ regrouping will also be finalized in a future release.

\section{Conclusion}
The library pyFAI was developed with two main goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performing azimuthal integration with a clean programming interface.
\item No compromise on the quality of the result is accepted: a careful
management of the geometry and precise pixel splitting offering total and local intensity
conservation.
\end{itemize}
PyFAI is the first implementation of azimuthal integration on
graphic card and the twenty fold speed up observed opens the
door to a new kind of analysis, not even considered before:
a 10-lines script is sufficient for reducing the data of a whole diffraction
tomography experiment, such analysis takes a few minutes using pyFAI on
a 60 x 200 frames dataset when it used to take days.
PyFAI is the tool to couple with the next generation high-speed detectors.
