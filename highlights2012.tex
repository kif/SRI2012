ISDD Commun building blocks

Python programming language for scientific computing and especially data
analysis.

Allow to be integrated into larger programs (PyMca)

ipython + numpy toolbox for scientific for designing algorithms

Missing building blocks developpes by ISDD like pyHST for tomographic
reconstructions and pyFAI for azimuthal regrouping\ldots.

Tools mainly used for azimuthal integration like fit2d or spd are not
compatible with this library approach. 

Retained the geometry of spd and a pixels splitting algorith close to the one of
fit2d.
